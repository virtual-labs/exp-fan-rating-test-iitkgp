## Procedure

- At the traversing section in the duct plane the Pitot static tube with the nose at center, facing the air in the air stream
- To the Pitot tube connect the Askania to measure velocity pressure, and inclined tube manometer to measure the static pressure. Level these two instruments and take their initial reading.
- Make wattmeter connections and start the fan. Use the symmetrical conical throttle provided at the duct outlet to vary the quantity in the duct.
- For each throttle bottle measure the
    - Motor input power
    - Fan RPM
    - Static and velocity pressures at the traverse section
- Measure the L and D values; obtain wet and dry bulb temperatures and barometric pressures at the fan inlet. Obtain a representative of dry bulb temperature inside the duct.
